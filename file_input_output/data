Kohli did push up the intent towards the 30th over only for Hazlewood.
If the previous two short balls got Kohli on the pull,
this one was wider and took the nick as he played it on the walk.
He ended the year without an ODI century,
but any mortal would take two half-centuries in a three-match series in what is bound to be a rusty year.
